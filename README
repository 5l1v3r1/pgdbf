This is the source distribution of PgDBF, a program for converting XBase DBF
files into a format that PostgreSQL can import.  It was written by Kirk
Strauser <kirk@daycos.com>, and generously allowed to be released as Free
Software by his boss, Brandon Day.

Please see http://pgdbf.sourceforge.net/ for further details, reporting
