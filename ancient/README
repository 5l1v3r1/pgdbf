This is the origin of PgDBF. Xbase (or xbase64 or XDB, depending where you
look) is a package for manipulating DBF files. I based my first conversion
project on it and published it as a set of patches to apply against the Xbase
source. This worked pretty well for a while, but the Xbase project's goals
were different from mine and I eventually decided to start over from scratch.

This is the patch file I published in 2008. I'm providing it for historical
purposes or in the unlikely chance that someone really, really needs it for
some reason.
